⚛️ Backend Project Setup Notes
==========================================================================================================
🔧 Terminal Setup Summary
1. python -m venv venv: 
👉 Creates a new virtual environment named venv, This is an isolated environment to install project-specific dependencies without polluting your global Python environment.

2. source venv/Scripts/activate: 
👉 Activates the virtual environment so any packages you install with pip go inside venv.

3. pip install -r requirements.txt: 
👉 Installs all the packages listed in requirements.txt, such as:
    Flask: Web server
    Flask-CORS: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (needed for frontend-backend interaction)
    Flask-SQLAlchemy: ORM to talk to the database using Python
    python-dotenv: To load environment variables from .env file


🐍 Python Shell (Interactive Python session)
4. from _init_ import create_app, db: 
👉 This imports the create_app() factory function and db instance from your Flask app.

5. app = create_app(): 
👉 Initializes your Flask app by:
    Creating the app object
    Loading config
    Initializing DB (db.init_app(app))
    Registering the API blueprint

6. app.app_context().push()
👉 Creates an application context manually, so you can interact with Flask-specific features like current_app, g, and db outside of a request.

7. db.create_all()
👉 Tells SQLAlchemy to create all tables defined in your models (inside models.py) in your configured database.

8. exit()
👉 Exits the Python shell.

====================================================================================================================================

📁 __init__.py
This is the Flask application factory file. It bootstraps your app.

1. Flask(__name__): Creates the Flask app
2. app.config.from_object(Config): Loads configuration (like DB URI) from config.py
3. db.init_app(app): Binds SQLAlchemy to this app
4. CORS(app): Enables CORS so your frontend (React) can talk to this backend
5. app.register_blueprint(api): Adds route handlers from routes.py

Purpose: Bootstraps and returns a fully configured app


📁 config.py
Handles app configuration settings.

1. SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI: Where your SQLite DB lives (in this case, app.db)
2. SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS: Disables unnecessary event system

Purpose: Central place to define environment variables or DB configs.


📁 models.py
Defines your database schema using SQLAlchemy.

1. Expense is a table with columns: id, description, amount, category, date
2. db.Model gives it ORM power (can use .query, .add, .commit, etc.)

Purpose: Data model that maps to your DB.


📁 routes.py
Handles API routes using Flask Blueprints.

code:

from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify
from models import Expense, db
from datetime import datetime
api = Blueprint('api', __name__)

-----0__0-----
Code-Example route:

@api.route('/expenses', methods=['POST'])
def add_expense():
    data = request.get_json()
    expense = Expense(
        description=data['description'],
        amount=data['amount'],
        category=data['category'],
        date=datetime.strptime(data['date'], '%Y-%m-%d')
    )
    db.session.add(expense)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({'message': 'Expense added successfully'}), 201
-----0__0-----

1. Blueprint: Modularizes your routes
2. request.get_json(): Reads JSON body
3. Expense(...): Creates a new record
4. db.session.add + commit: Saves to database

Purpose: Defines the backend API endpoints your React frontend will hit.


📁 app.py (Optional)
If you want to run the app directly (instead of using WSGI server):
code:

from _init_ import create_app
app = create_app()
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
-----0__0-----

Purpose: Entry point if you're running via python app.py

🛠️ Terminal Commands (React Setup)
1. npx create-react-app frontend : 👉 Bootstraps a new React project with all default configs
2. cd frontend: 👉 Enters the project directory
3. npm start: 👉 Starts the development server (http://localhost:3000)


🧩 Key React Files
📄 index.js: Entry point of the app, Renders the <App /> component into the DOM
📄 App.js: Main component that holds your layout and renders AddExpense and ExpenseList
Example Code:
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Smart Budget Tracker</h1>
      <AddExpense />
      <ExpenseList />
    </div>
  );
}

-----0__0-----

📄 AddExpense.js: A form component to enter a new expense, Handles form inputs and sends POST request to backend, Sends data like: description, amount, category, date
📄 ExpenseList.js: Fetches and displays expenses from backend using GET /expenses, Maps each expense to a row or card in a list.


🔄 React + Backend Communication
We’ll use axios to send and receive data:
    1. axios.post('/expenses', { ... }) → Add new expense
    2. axios.get('/expenses') → Get list of expenses
📦 Install: npm install axios


💡 React Concepts Recap
| Concept       | Meaning                                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **JSX**       | HTML + JS syntax inside components                         |
| **Props**     | Data passed to components                                  |
| **State**     | Local component data (like form inputs or fetched results) |
| **Hooks**     | `useState`, `useEffect` etc., to manage state/lifecycle    |
| **axios**     | Library to make HTTP requests (like fetch, but cleaner)    |
| **npm start** | Runs dev server (hot-reload enabled)                       |

🧠 What We’ve Done So Far (React Summary)
1. Set up a React app using create-react-app which gives us a fully functional frontend environment with zero config.
2. Created the main layout in App.js, which acts as a "controller" to render two key components:
      AddExpense.js → A form where users can type in new expenses.
      ExpenseList.js → A section that will display the list of added expenses (fetched from backend later).
3. These components are like "mini apps" within the app — each handling its own UI and logic.
4. React uses state to keep track of input values and updates the UI without refreshing the page.
5. We're setting the stage to connect to the Flask backend, send expense data, and display it dynamically.
6. No complex logic or backend talk yet — just UI scaffolding to collect and show information.

May 18 Notes
================================================================================================

✅ How the flow works:
1. 🟢 User submits the form in <AddExpense />
React sends the form data up to Dashboard.js through the onAdd prop.

2. 🟢 Dashboard.js calls addExpense(expense) from api.js
3. 🔁 api.js uses fetch() to send a POST request to Flask:
http
Copy
Edit
POST http://localhost:5000/expenses
It sends the form data as a JSON body.

4. 🔵 Flask receives the POST request at:
python
Copy
Edit
@api.route('/expenses', methods=['POST'])
Flask uses request.get_json() to extract the data.

It saves that data in the database using SQLAlchemy.

Then it sends back a JSON response with the saved expense.

5. 🔄 React receives the response (via addExpense in api.js)
This returned expense is added to the expenses state using setExpenses([...])

ExpenseList.js rerenders and displays the new expense entry.

💬 So yes:
React → api.js → Flask → DB

Flask → JSON response → api.js → React UI update

🧠 Think of api.js as the bridge between frontend and backend.

📘 Smart Budget Tracker — Fullstack Project (May 18)
🔧 Backend Setup & Flow
✅ Flask listens for POST requests on /expenses route. React sends form data there.
•	• routes.py contains @api.route('/expenses', methods=['POST']) to receive expense data.
•	• request.get_json() reads JSON sent from React form.
•	• Flask parses data, creates Expense object, saves it using db.session.add() + commit().
•	• Flask sends back a JSON response with saved expense fields.
•	• Expense model includes: user_id, type, category, amount, date, note.
•	• Flask CORS enabled via CORS(app) so React can talk to backend.
•	• App bootstrapped via create_app() from __init__.py.
•	• Database initialized using db.create_all() inside app context.


⚛️ React Frontend Setup
•	• Dashboard.js holds the state of expenses and handles adding new entries.
•	• AddExpense.js is a form component that collects: type, category, amount, date, note.
•	• Form submission triggers onAdd prop → calls handleAddExpense().
•	• handleAddExpense() calls addExpense() from services/api.js.
•	• api.js uses fetch() to POST data to Flask backend.
•	• After response, the new expense is added to expenses state via setExpenses.
•	• ExpenseList.js maps the expenses and renders a list including category, amount, date, note, and type.
•	• type dropdown added with options: expense, income.
•	• date is converted to user-readable format using new Date(date).toLocaleDateString().


🔄 React–Flask Connection Recap

React and Flask communicate using HTTP, not direct imports.

→ React (via api.js) sends a POST request to Flask: fetch('http://localhost:5000/expenses', {...})

→ Flask receives it on @api.route('/expenses', methods=['POST']), processes it, saves to DB.

→ Flask sends back a JSON response.

→ React updates the UI using setExpenses() and re-renders ExpenseList.js.
